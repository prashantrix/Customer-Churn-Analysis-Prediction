📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

A data-driven deep dive into customer behavior, churn patterns, and retention insights — built with ruthless clarity and zero sugarcoating.

🚀 Overview

This project analyzes customer churn patterns using a telecom dataset of 7,043 customers.
The goal was simple: expose the truth behind why customers leave and visualize the patterns through powerful dashboards.

The dashboard highlights:

📉 Overall churn rate

🧾 Contract-type churn comparison

💳 Payment method risk levels

⏳ Tenure-driven churn patterns

🌐 Internet service churn differences

👤 Demographic & behavioral segmentation

💵 Monthly charge vs. tenure impact

The results are uncomfortable but necessary — churn isn’t random.
It’s predictable.
And avoidable.

🧠 Key Insights
🔥 1. Churn Rate: 27%

A massive red flag for any subscription business.

🔥 2. Month-to-Month Contracts → Highest Churn

Flexibility becomes an escape route when value isn’t delivered.

🔥 3. Electronic Check = Churn Hotspot

Payment behavior is one of the strongest churn predictors.

🔥 4. Early Tenure Churn = Failed Value Delivery

If customers leave early, expectation ≠ experience.

🔥 5. Fiber Users Pay More… and Churn More

Premium service does not guarantee premium loyalty.

🔥 6. Gender Doesn’t Matter — Behavior Does

Patterns, not demographics, reveal the real story.
